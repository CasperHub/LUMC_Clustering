This repository is a compilation of scripts that can sequentially be ran with the following general workflow:
1. Load data (Pre-processing) 
2. Filter & Normalize data (Pre-processing)
3. Dimension reduction
4. Clustering*
5. Scoring*

*The clustering and scoring has not been separated as each application of the 
scoring metric requires specific application to the cluster algorithm used.

**"6. Package practise" speaks for itself and is irrelevant for running clustering.
