# LUMC_Clustering

This repository is a compilation of scripts that can sequentially be ran with the following general workflow:
1. Pre-processing: Loading data, filtering, and normalization
2. Dimension reduction, choose from: PCA, TSNE, and UMAP
3. Clustering & Scoring, choose from: Centroid-based, Connectivity-based, Density-based, and Graph-based methods. 

Alternatively a full run can be selected in which a default workflow has been used.
Default: Full data, low expression filtering, normalization, pca, clustering method, silhouette scoring.

*6. Package practise" speaks for itself and is irrelevant for running clustering.
